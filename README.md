# 🏆 Job Portal in PHP - My Early PHP Project  

This is one of my **first PHP projects**, developed when I was learning **PHP, MySQL, and web development**. While it may not be modern, it reflects my early struggles, efforts, and learning process. 💡  

## 🚀 Features
- User Registration & Login  
- Job Listings & Applications  
- Admin Panel to Manage Jobs  
- Database Integration (MySQL)  

## 🔥 Technologies Used
- PHP  
- MySQL  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Bootstrap  

## 📌 Future Improvements
If I were to build this project again today, I would:
- Use **Laravel or Node.js** instead of raw PHP  
- Implement **React for the frontend**  
- Improve security with **JWT Authentication**  
- Optimize the database design  

Despite its simplicity, this project marks my **early days in web development**, and I’m proud of it! 🎉
